        Welcome to Azure magma documentation
      </h1>
      <center><img src="magma.png"></center>
      <p class="">
        A Magma is one of the simplests structure one can imagine: it's a mere set equiped with an operation.
	    We use it to store Azure <strong>Network Security Groups (NSGs)</strong> of a whole organization to reason about their security at scale and automatically.
      </p>
	  <br>
	  <p class="">
        Technically, Azure Magma holds the security rules of your NSGs in the form of hyperrectangles (rectangles in a 4D space made of protocols, source IPs, destination IPs, and destination port)
		The operation acting on hyperrectangles is the union operation, denoted '+'. Thus, a NSG can be thought of as an addition of many hyperrectangles.
      </p>
	  <br>
	  <p></p><br>&nbsp;	 
<h2 class="title has-text-white is-size-4">Property 1: rules equivalence</h2> 
	  <p class="">
        <p>The Magma is partitioned into two equivalence classes, called <strong>allow</strong> and <strong>block</strong>. The resulting partition is a Maqma Quotient.</p><br>
		The ONE single principle to understand for scalability is that all security rules belonging to the same class are equivalent:<br>
		Suppose a security rule allows flows from 'VirtualNetwork' to '*' on port 80 in a NSG implemented in subscription A, and that another rule allows flows from '10.0.0.0/8' to '10.10.0.0/16' on port 443 in 
		a NSG implemented in subscription B.<br>
		=======> <i>For Magma, both security rules will be the equivalent!</i>
		<br>
		<p><br>That's why it is critically important to scope Azure Magma to similar subscriptions, using proper management groups.</p>
      </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Please consult the <a href="reference.html">reference guide</a> for detailed operations.</p>
	  	  <p></p><br>&nbsp;	 
<h2 class="title has-text-white is-size-4">Property 2: depriorization</h2> 
	  <p class="">
	  In an Azure NSG, security rules are given a priority: this is not the case with Magma: all rules have the same priority. There are no possible conflicts between
	  allowed rules and denied rules, because of the structure of the Magma Quotient.
	  <p></p><br>&nbsp;	
<h2 class="title has-text-white is-size-4">Property 3: catch-all rule</h2> 
	  <p class="">
	  You must have a default catch-all deny rule in every NSG which blocks everything that hasn't been explicitely allowed. 
	  In deployed NSGs, this rule shouldn't be overriden by a more lenient, higher priority one, of course. 
	  </p><br>&nbsp;
<h2 class="title has-text-white is-size-4">Magmatic systems</h2> 
	  <p class="">
	  Information systems / cloud deployments meeting the 3 above properties are compatible with the NSG management paradigm of Azure Magma: they are called <strong>Magmatic Systems</strong>.

	  <h1 class="title has-text-white">Azure Magma concepts and definitions</h1>
	  Azure Magma is currently in <strong>preview</strong>.<br>
	  A <strong>proposition</strong> is an unproven NSG security rule: it is neither allowed, nor blocked (denied).
	  <br>An <strong>axiom</strong> is a proven NSG security rule: it is either allowed, or blocked.
	</div>
	<div class="container">
	<br>Magma handles NSGs which are:
	<ul class="custom-list">
		<li> not default Microsoft rules</li>
		<li> allowed</li>
		<li> inbound or outbound</li>
		<li> associated to an actual NIC or to an actual subnet</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>
	Security rules are given a priority in NSGs: rules with a higher priority take precedence over rules with a lower priority. 
	Magma doesn't work like this: it reasons only on allowed rules, <i>regardless of their priority</i>.
	So, if denied rules and allowed rules are interspersed within a same NSG, it will wreak havoc to Magma's reasoning capabilities.
	</p><br>
	<p>For Magma to behave as expected, all denied custom rules must be removed from NSGs except one: a <strong>catch-all deny</strong> rule with lowest priority.
	This rule will be implicitly assumed by Magma, it's up to you to verify it is systematically enforced in all your NSGs.
	</p><br>
	<p>Axioms (i.e. all proven security rules) are stored in the <i>Magma Quotient</i>. 
	As we explained, the Magma Quotient is a partition of the space of all proven security rules (the Magma), it's made of two equivalence classes, and one operation: <i>addition</i>.
	Allowed rules are members of the <i>"allowed" equivalence class</i>. Blocked rules are members of the <i>"blocked" equivalence class</i>.
	Security rules are additive, and the addition is congruent. This is the key property that we maintain at all times, not to break consistency of the Magma Quotient.
	</p><br>
	<p> Why do we need a "blocked" equivalence class if we don't handle denied rules? 
	<br>That's because we want to <i>review</i> every single security rule in allowed state in Azure.
	<ol class="custom-list">
	<li>allowed and <span class="has-text-success">valid</span> rules are meant to belong the allowed equivalence class</li>
	<li>allowed and <span class="has-text-danger">invalid</span> rules are meant to belong the blocked equivalence class</li>
	</ol><br>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Why do we need a blocked equivalence class if we have a catch-all deny rule?<br> 
	Blocked axioms are absolutely essential for automation: by reasoning using both allowed and blocked axioms, Magma can streamline the unsupervised classification of new 
	security rules, and can break them down efficiently into their axioms and unknown coponents. Ultimately, this is what makes human review scalable.<br>
	Blocked axioms, however, must be limited to the bare necessities. The widest their span, the highest the risk of overlapping with allowed axioms which should take precedence.
	</p>
	<p>Why should we do with our blocked axioms?<br>
	Those are the sign that some allowed security rules in local NSGs are misconfigured. Teams in charge of modifying NSGs should refactor the offending allowed 
	security rules so that they dont overlap with block axioms.
    <br>
	Magma is very helpful for that, because it explains the overlapping/conflicting ranges.

	  <h1 class="title has-text-white">Known limitations</h1>	
		In the Preview, we don't support:
		<ol class="custom-list">
		<li>Azure network security tags in wildcards. A source address prefix like '*' will not include tags like 'VirtualNetwork', for example. You will need to add an extra explicit axiom for each tag of interest</li>
		<li>Application Security groups</li>
		</ol>
<br>
	    Other longer-term unsupported features:
		<ol class="custom-list">
		<li>Denies in security rules. Because Magma doesn't manage rule priorities, if some of your custom rules feature denies with a higher priority than allows, it will wreak havoc into the logic</li>
		<li>If you are using Azure managed VNets, security admin rules are not supported by Magma</li>
		</ol>

   All operations are carried out using the Magma CLI, which is <a href="https://labyrinthinesecurity.github.io/magma/reference.html">documented here</a>.<br>
   The theoretical foundations of Magma were originally articulated in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introducing-azure-magma-christophe-parisel/">my newsletter</a>.<br>
