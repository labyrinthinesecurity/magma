        What is a Magma?
      </h2>
      <p class="">
        A magma is one of the simplest structure one can imagine: it's a set equipped with an operation.
We use it to store Azure <strong>Network Security Groups (NSGs)</Strong> of a whole organization to reason about their security at scale and automatically.
The operation attached to NSGs is also quite simple: it's the union of rules, that we note as a plus sign '+'. <br>
In practice, we have two different magmas: one for the <strong>inbound</strong> direction, and another one for the <strong>outbound</strong> one.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="">
        Our magmas are always partitioned into two isolated zones (called equivalence classes):
<ul>
<li> - allowed rules
<li> - blocked rules
</ul>
        This makes sense, because a security rule cannot be allowed and blocked at the same time.
        The resulting structure is called a <strong>Magma Quotient</strong>. This is the actual space in which all the reasoning takes place.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      An interesting property of the (otherwise boring) Magma Quotient is that the '+' operation is <strong>congruent</strong>. It means that whenever we 'add' two security rules together, provided they belong to the same equivalence class, the resulting object remains in the same equivalence class.
